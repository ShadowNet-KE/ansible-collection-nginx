# Ansible NGINX Configuration Role

This role configures NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus on your target host.

**Note:** This role is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues and the role variables may change as development continues.

## Requirements

### Ansible

* This role is developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) versions of Ansible core (above `2.11`).
* When using Ansible core, you will also need to install the following collections:

    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
      - name: community.general
        version: 4.7.0
      - name: ansible.posix
        version: 1.3.0
      - name: community.docker  # Only required if you plan to use Molecule (see below)
        version: 2.3.0
    ```

    **Note:** You can alternatively install the Ansible community distribution (what is known as the "old" Ansible) if you don't want to manage individual collections.
* Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#upgrading-ansible-from-version-2-9-and-older-to-version-2-10-or-later).

### Jinja2

* This role uses Jinja2 templates. Ansible core installs Jinja2 by default, but depending on your install and/or upgrade path, you might be running an outdated version of Jinja2. The minimum version of Jinja2 required for the role to properly function is `2.11`.
* Instructions on how to install Jinja2 can be found in the [Jinja2 website](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/intro/#installation).

### Molecule (Optional)

* Molecule is used to test the various functionalities of the role. The recommended version of Molecule to test this role is `3.3`.
* Instructions on how to install Molecule can be found in the [Molecule website](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). *You will also need to install the Molecule Docker driver.*
* To run the NGINX Plus/App Protect config Molecule tests, you must copy your NGINX Plus/App Protect license to the role's [`files/license`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config/blob/main/files/license/) folder.

You can alternatively add your NGINX Plus/App Protect repository certificate and key to the local environment. Run the following commands to export these files as base64-encoded variables and execute the Molecule tests:

```bash
export NGINX_CRT=$( cat <path to your certificate file> | base64 )
export NGINX_KEY=$( cat <path to your key file> | base64 )
molecule test -s plus
```
